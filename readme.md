Welcome to the `Pivot Point Tick Indicator` project! 
  This temporary solution enables the display of pivot points on tick charts 
  in Quantower. The platformâ€™s native pivot point indicator does not currently 
  support tick charts properly due to its internal implementation.

A pivot point is a technical indicator used to identify potential support and 
  resistance levels based on the previous session's high, low, and close.
